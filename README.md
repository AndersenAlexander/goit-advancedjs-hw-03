🌟 Image Search Application
This is a web application built to search for images using the Pixabay public API. The project aims to strengthen understanding of backend interaction through HTTP Requests and the use of asynchronous JavaScript functions.



📝 Features
Advanced Image Search: Enter a search term to display a gallery of relevant images.
Responsive Design: The interface is optimized for all devices, and images are displayed in an adaptive grid format.
Backend Interaction: Data is fetched from the Pixabay API using fetch, async/await, and promise handling.
Dynamic Pagination: A "Load More" button allows users to load more images without refreshing the page.
Image Zoom Gallery: Users can click on images to view larger versions using the SimpleLightbox library.
Dynamic Error Messages: Notifications are displayed using the iziToast library for an enhanced user experience.
Loading Indicator: While fetching data from the server, a loading indicator keeps users informed.
